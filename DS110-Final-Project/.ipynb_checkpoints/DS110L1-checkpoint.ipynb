    "\n",
    "The typical work cycle of a data scientist goes something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Talk to the process owners and try to gain some clarity on the data: where it comes from, how it is generated, are there any knobs or dials that can be turned to change the outcome, etc.\n",
    "-  Explore, clean up, and wrangle the data to better understand it. This can include performing some simple visualizations to better understand the data and determining which variables make sense as independent versus dependent variables. \n",
    "-  Return to the data owner and present findings.  This provides an opportunity to learn more about the data, discuss key findings, and do a preliminary presentation.  This almost always leads to more questions from the data owner, more ideas about where to go next, and even more data that might not have been available earlier or might not have seemed important to the process owner at the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, it is wash, rinse, repeat.  In theory, projects like this could go on for the rest of your career, but in all likelihood, your company will not want to lose you to a single data set for the rest of time.  The big exception to this is if you are doing research - in this case, you could literally spend 20 years or more focusing on a single data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical analysis is an iterative process.  It is very unusual for someone to bring you a pristine data set and ask for one simple analysis. The reality is that you usually have some freedom to explore the data, and go where your nose leads you.  You might end up going down a bunch of rabbit holes that produce no results, but this, too, is part of the job. As a data scientist, you have a chance to utilize both your creativity and your curiosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# How Does this Apply to You?\n",
    "\n",
    "You and your team will be both the process owner and the data scientist in this project! This means that you will be in charge of finding the data, directing yourselves to analyze data, and the iterative process involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a basic overview of the steps you will take in your final project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decide on a topic.  Your world is wide open, so pick something that interests you, either personally or professionally.\n",
    "* Find data on that topic.\n",
    "* Determine at least two questions that you can answer using the data you have chosen.\n",
    "* Choose your analyses.  What statistical or machine learning techniques will you use to answer your questions? \n",
    "* Understand the requirements for that analysis.  What data will you need? What wrangling needs to be done in order to complete the analysis?\n",
    "* Wrangle your data.\n",
    "* Analyze your data.\n",
    "* Visualize your data and the analyses you did with it.\n",
    "* Build your presentation.\n",
    "* Practice your presentation.\n",
    "* Give your presentation and graduate with pride!\n",
    "\n",

    "## Considerations when Picking Data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many things to consider when picking a dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Do you like data wrangling?** Some datasets are already nice and clean, and ready for analysis.  You just need to pop 'em in a statistical analysis or machine learning algorithm and you are good to go.  Others, especially those found on data.gov, may require a lot of wrangling.  How much are you willing to do? Keep in mind that data wrangling is often 90% of real projects and that employers will expect you to have some wrangling skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Do you have enough data?** Most of the more complicated analyses require at least 200 rows as a rough guideline.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Do you have too much data?** Given that you don't actually have a big data cluster running multiple nodes, and you probably don't want to pay for one, choose a dataset that is manageable in size so that you can run it yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **How much data is missing?** If you find that 75% of the data is missing, then you may end up not having enogh data after all.  And if that data is essentatial to the topic at hand, then that's another reason you might not be able to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Is there data on your topic?** Again, if you can't find any data on a particular topic, it may be better to pick your second favorite topic that go on a wild goose chase.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Will you have to piece together data from different sources?** Doing so can be awesome and fun, and demonstrates a wider range of skills.  But it can also be a nightmare! If you are interested in doing some data joining, then make sure you pick data that has a common key and that makes sense to combine.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What stipulations, if any, are put on the use of the data?** Do you need to pay a fee? Report on your findings somewhere? Make everything anonymous? Add in a reference to the data source? It's a good idea to find out in advance so you are not surprised later.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Is the data commonly used?** You want to demonstrate to employers that you can work off the beaten track.  If you pick a very common dataset that has lots of tutorials about how to analyze it, then you run the chance of being \"same old, same old\" and not drawing attention to yourself, no matter how well you completed the project. Especially avoid datasets built into Python and R, since those are some of the most overused datasets out there!\n",
    "\n",
    "Paying attention to some of these considerations can really make or break you - thinking through the ramifications of your dataset in advance can make the difference between a project in which you spend all of your time cursing your data and a project that is a breeze and moves along smoothly. Snooping very briefly through the data and considering the above questions will save you a lot of time later.\n",

For instance, you might ask a question like \"How do health metrics differ between ethnicities?\" Although that is somewhat general, as \"health metrics\" and \"ethnicities\" can encompass many different components and variables, you can use your data to point towards specific components there.  If you have columns in your data about disability level, number of times someone has gone to the doctor in the last month, and the amount of money they have spent on medications, you have now quantified, or translated, \"health metrics\" into something that you can actually look at and measure. \n",

    "# Choosing your Analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have at least two evaluation questions, your next step is to determine what data and analyses you can use to actually answer those questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, start by identifying your independent, or predictor, variable, and your dependent, or outcome, variable.  Remember that your dependent variable is what you are trying to predict - it is the thing you want to know about.  Your independent variable or variables (most advances analyses will allow you to have more than one) are the things that you think might influence the dependent variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, you will need to identify what data types the independent and dependent variables are.  Do you have categorical variables, that are just groupings? Or do you have something continuos, that is a number, and when you have a higher number, it means that you have more of the variable? Don't be fooled - you can have a categorical variable that looks like a number, but isn't actually continuous.  For instance, what if you recode the color of dogs from brown, black, and white to 0, 1, and 2? It may look like a number, but does having a 1 mean that there is more fur or more dog, versus having a zero? No! So even though the variable has numbers, it is categorical, not continuous. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, you will need to determine how many levels of those variables you have, when you have a categorical variable.  Do you have only two groups, or more than two? \n",

If you want to complete advanced statistics or modeling like regression, ANOVAS, or MANOVAs, you most likely want to take advantage of R's ability to rigorously test assumptions and easily conduct those analyses. \n",

    "\n",
    "For this week's hands-on, you will be asked to create a project proposal document, like you did in your Project Management module. Here you will learn exactly how each section in that project proposal relates to starting a data project. This is something you may be asked to do on the job, so it's great to get extra practice!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The executive summary is a quick review of **everything** that is in the rest of your document. Especially if you have a military background, you may have heard this also referred to as a *\"BLUF\" - bottom line up front*. It's a way for the important people in your company to get the down and dirty details quickly and without a lot of extra reading. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though it comes at the beginning, sometimes it can be easier to write the executive summary at the end - it's easier to summarize all the details once you already know them!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Your business objectives should include your evaluation questions. What are you trying to answer or solve with your data work?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "You can't assume that everyone has the same level of subject matter expertise on a particular topic, so in the background section, you want to give an overview of the topic, the problem, and why it matters. Think about this in terms of building a business case: if you were to ask for funding to do this project, what would convince a client, manager, or other stakeholder to give it the green light? You want to include that information here.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine your project is on a stage, and it can only be followed by one spotlight. What are the components that the spotlight will hit? Those factors are considered *in scope*. Anything that is relevant to your project and you're willing to tackle will be included, but anything that is a \"rabbit trail\" leading you out of the spotlight or off the stage altogether will be excluded, which is called *out of scope*. It's very important to define your scope thoroughly because if you don't, its easy for other people to shift you off course. Getting derailed by others is called *scope creep*, and it can be deadly to delivering a project on-time and on-target. When other people suddenly start asking you for additional other components, and you haven't budgeted for those other needs, resources, and time, your project can get off track quickly. Sometimes this happens because of genuine interest or enthusiasm on the part of others, and sometimes it can happen because they have their own political agenda within the organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stalwart guardian against scope creep is a well-defined scope! What are you willing to do for this project, and what are you unwilling to do? Think about things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What programs are you willing to use and what are you unwilling to use?\n",
    "* Are you willing to learn any new skills for this?\n",
    "* Are you willing to work more than 20 hours per week to finish?\n",
    "* Are you willing to add or change data if asked?\n",
    "* What analyses are you willing to complete and which ones are you not?\n",
    "\n",
    "While your instructor will not throw you out of scope, really thinking through this section will help you tremendously in the business world.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The functional requirements are the bread-and-butter of your project proposal document. This is where you will outline all your plans for the completion of your project. Items you'll need to include in this section are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Programs / languages to be used\n",
    "* Information about your dataset and source\n",
    "* Variables and analyses you'll utilize to answer the questions in the business objectives section\n",
    "\n",
    "You should already have a fair amount of this section thought through from the other activities in this lesson. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Personnel Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Personnel means people, which means you and your project partners if you have them! You'll also want to mention your instructor and mentors, since they will help along your journey. \n",
    "\n",
    "Estimate your time, and your teammates time, that you plan to spend on this project throughout the weeks. You can assume an average of approximately 20 hours per week per person, as a guide. When will you complete individual work? How about work as a team? When will team meetings take place, both with your instructor and without? Make sure you discuss all these factors and get a game plan together for how you will complete your work each week.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Delivery Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "HooBoy, this is where things get real! In the delivery schedule section, you will want to plan out the remaining five weeks of your final project lives as best you can! For every week, you should have a list of tasks that need to be completed. Remember, this is the basic outline to go by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Week 1: Project Planning\n",
    "* Week 2: Data Wrangling\n",
    "* Week 3: Data Exploration\n",
    "* Week 4: Data Analysis\n",
    "* Week 5: Data Visualization\n",
    "* Week 6: Data Reporting and Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "You will present your final project to the career services team, your instructor, fellow peers, and potential employers in Week 6 (please remember to turned in your last documents on or before the deadline).\n",
    "\n",
    "This brief outline is not enough. Push yourself to dive in deeper. Based on the data and questions you have picked, you should be able to outline what analyses you will complete, what visualizations make sense, and what data wrangling will be required. Getting tasks and time worked out ahead of time means that you'll spend less time contemplating your navel and more time doing project-related work in the next five weeks!\n",
    "\n",
    "Overachievers, make sure you leave yourself a little wiggle room, because indubitably, something will not go to plan. You may realize you didn't take care of all the wrangling required or that a certain analysis just isn't possible after all. That is ok! These things happen, and data work tends to be an iterative cycle: proceed until you hit an error, go back through and do work to solve the error, lather, rinse, repeat. Just make sure you have a time cushion to handle it. \n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions are outside factors that the project depends upon, but which you have little to no control over. For instance, you may assume a program such as Python will be working and not buggy. It's important to note the things you are depending upon, because their failure could severely derail you project. A good project manager is able to navigate around failed assumptions if they happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "A limitation is a threat to your project that is internal to you and your team. It's a known weakness that you want to document so that you can plan around it. Remember that saying, \"plan for the worst and hope for the best?\" That is exactly what you are doing here, both in this limitations section and also in this proposal document as a whole. Limitations could be known gaps in your knowledge or skills, or they could be things like scheduling, communication, and timing issues. It's a great idea to discuss limitations with your team, because again, it allows you to plan for them instead of letting them derail you.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "A risk is similar to a limitation in that it is a threat to your project, but instead of being internal, a risk is external to your project or team. Risks are things that you don't necessarily have control over. This makes them a little more difficult to think through and plan, but the more you do so, the more stable your project will be if you hit some waves. \n",
    "\n",
    "A great example of a risk is loss of internet due to bad weather. What will you or your teammates do if you lose internet? You can't control that, but you can plan ahead to deal with it. Maybe you can head to a family or friend's house. Maybe you can hit a public library or a cafe with internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to put on your pessimism hat and think through all the weird and wooly scenarios, and then put an action plan in place with which to deal with them!\n"
