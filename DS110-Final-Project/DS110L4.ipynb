    "By this point, you should know exactly what you are doing in regards to data analysis.  You have planned the analyses you will do, wrangled your data for them, and are ready to hit the big time! Whatever analysis you choose, whatever programming language you choose to do it in, make sure that you do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Document your code:**  This will allow you to better understand your work if you need to look back at it, and will show off organization skills to potential employers.\n",
    "* **Display code in the correct order:** Especially in Jupyter Notebook, it is easy to run things in any order and so if you open it up and try running the entire file, it won't run, because your code isn't in order.  No matter whether you are using R or Python, ensuring your code is in the correct order will save you heartache later and again demonstrate your organization and coding prowess to potential employers.  You don't want them to actually try running your code and come up with errors, do you?! That would be mortifying.\n",
    "* **Never work on the original data:** Duuude, do you want to have accidentally written over your entire dataset and need to start over? Absolutely not.  By continually saving additional copies, you can just go to the version beforehand, rather than the beginning, if you accidentally make a mistake. And you're learning - so mistakes are expected.  All that matters is how you recover!\n",

If you get no significant results, or your accuracy is very low, look to your exploratory analsyses to get a second wind.  They may provide some insight as to what other variables to include or what other analyses to try.  Now that your data is pretty much all wrangled, you have a little freedom to try several different things if the first doesn't work out.\n",
