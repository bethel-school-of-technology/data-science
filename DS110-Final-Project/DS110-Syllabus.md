# DS110 Final Project

**Course Description:** The Group Project course combines each part of the program into a group project for the student.  Each student will work together as a team member for the group project, which includes daily scrum meetings to cover tasks and progress while working separately to complete them. The final group project is due at the end of the course.

### In Class Activities-120 Hours

Students will organize into groups, and select areas of interest in which to perform analysis and reporting.
Students will meet regularly via Slack and Skype to communicate progress, findings, new ideas, and subsequent analytical strategy.
It is expected that analytical process is documented and put in the summary of the project history. A project report with graphs and techniques will be prepared.
Students will complete the following steps for the Data Science Program Group Project:

1.	Design a study used for the experimental process
2.	Create hypotheses suitable for statistical testing
3.	Develop a sampling plan to collect data
4.	Find and utilize existing data sources
5.	Collect the appropriate data to answer experimental questions
6.	Perform statistical analysis to facilitate data-based decision making
7.	Use database tools to retrieve data from databases
8.	Use programming tools to reformat data, create data visualizations, and perform analyses
9.	Execute a practical process monitoring protocol
10.	Use big data tools to deal with large datasets
11.	Apply common machine learning techniques and modeling techniques to create new knowledge

### Outside Hours-40 Hours

Concepts learned during classwork will be reinforced through practical application throughout the group project work.
Students will spend extensive amounts of time working as a group and individually on their tasks for the group project.
